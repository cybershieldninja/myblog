Cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication, targeting vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed in traditional security assessments. Penetration testing—or ethical hacking—plays a vital role in identifying these weaknesses before malicious actors can exploit them. It’s not just a compliance checkbox; it’s a proactive defense mechanism for ensuring resilience, trust, and business continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
